# Reflective Practice

> **Reflective practice** is the conscious and structured process of examining one’s own actions, decisions, and outcomes to continuously improve understanding and performance. It is both a mirror and a guide: by observing past behavior, one identifies patterns, errors, and opportunities, and by interpreting these insights, one designs more effective future actions.
