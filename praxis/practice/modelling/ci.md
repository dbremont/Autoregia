# Confidence Interval

## Question 1

A manufacturer of a premium laminate and wood composite flooring system would like to demonstrate that their product experiences **less warpage** than hardwood flooring under fixed temperature and humidity conditions.

A random sample of size **10** from the laminate system produced a sample mean warpage of **2.7°**, and a random sample of size **12** from the hardwood flooring gave a sample mean warpage of **3.2°**. It is known that both systems have a true warpage variance of **0.8 degrees²**.

Assuming warpage for both products is normally distributed, find a **90% confidence interval** for

$$
\mu_1 - \mu_2
$$

where $\mu_1$ is the true mean warpage for laminate and $\mu_2$ is the true mean warpage for hardwood.

## Question 2

The same manufacturer would like to claim that their product experiences **less warpage** than hardwood flooring under fixed temperature and humidity conditions.

A random sample of size **10** from the laminate system produced a sample mean warpage of **2.7°** with a sample variance of **0.73**. A random sample of size **12** from the hardwood flooring produced a sample mean warpage of **3.2°** with a sample variance of **0.80**. It is believed that the true variances of the two systems are equal.

Assuming warpage for both products is normally distributed, find a **90% confidence interval** for

$$
\mu_1 - \mu_2
$$

where $\mu_1$ is the true mean warpage for laminate and $\mu_2$ is the true mean warpage for hardwood.

## Question 3

The **Slant Shear Test (SST)** is a widely used test for evaluating the bond of resinous repair materials to concrete. It was applied to two random samples of concrete slabs finished in different ways:

* **Population 1 (Smooth finish):** sample size = **138**, sample mean shear strength = **18.17 N/mm²**, sample variance = **1.78**.
* **Population 2 (Hand-chiseled finish):** sample size = **110**, sample mean shear strength = **21.66 N/mm²**, sample variance = **3.21**.

Find a **95% confidence interval** for

$$
\mu_1 - \mu_2
$$

where $\mu_1$ is the true mean shear strength for the smooth finish and $\mu_2$ is the true mean shear strength for the hand-chiseled finish.

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a random sample from the continuous uniform distribution on the interval from 0 to $\theta$ with $\theta > 0$.

Using the "cdf method" from this lesson, we can show that $Y_n = \max(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)$ has pdf given by
$f(y; \theta) = \begin{cases} \frac{n}{\theta^n} y^{n-1} & , \text{0 < y < } \theta \\ 0 & , \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

Which of the following is a valid $100(1 - \alpha)\%$ confidence interval for $\theta$.

## ...

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a random sample from the shifted continuous exponential rate 1 distribution with pdf
$f(x; \theta) = \begin{cases} e^{-(x-\theta)} & , \text{x > } \theta \\ 0 & , \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

Which of the following represents a 95% confidence interval for $\theta$ based on the minimum value $Y_n = \min(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)$.
