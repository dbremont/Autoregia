## Traffic Jam Model

> Consider modeling traffic jams on an avenue using probabilistic methods. Let $(X_t)$ be a random variable representing the traffic state at time $(t)$, where $(X_t = 1)$ indicates a traffic jam and $(X_t = 0)$ indicates normal flow. The goal is to determine the probability $P(X_t = 1)$ of a traffic jam occurring at a given time $(t)$, potentially accounting for dependencies on previous traffic states or external factors.
