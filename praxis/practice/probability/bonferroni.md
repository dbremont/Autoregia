Let $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ be events in a probability space.  Prove that:

$\sum_{i=1}^n \Pr(A_i)   - \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} \Pr(A_i \cap A_j)  \le \Pr\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\Big)$.

## Strategy

- Prove a simpler version of the theorem.
- Sketch the structure of that proof.
- Use the simple proof to generalize the result to the full theorem via induction.
