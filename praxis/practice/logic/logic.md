> Logic, proof techinques and formal systems related practice problems.

> Use a truth table to verify that the propositional formula $(P \wedge \neg Q) \vee (P \wedge Q)$ is logically equivalent to $P$.

> Translate the following statement into formal logic: "There are exactly two natural numbers $n$ such that $Q(n)$ is true."
