- How to think about this? How to think about this procedure? What’s the goal of this? What is the nature of this **modelling problem**? What is the nature of this **problem setting**?
- How to think about $p$? What is the interpretation o $p$?
- What to do with this?
- What does it means to solve this problem? How to we make sure that our solution is correct?
- Which **mental representation** framework used to accommodate this?
- What to evaluate this problem setting? How do we know p? How can we test $p$?
