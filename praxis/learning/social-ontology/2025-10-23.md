> Social reality is the emergent totality resulting from the interaction between agents, their shared cognitive frameworks, the objects and institutions they construct, and the material reality that constrains and enables their actions.

> Note that the idea of only ontic and non ontic elements is partially right - because there are ontic elemetns  relevent for the undersanding of the social field;  let say a physical sign -  that non-theless - just an elemetn of reality - is something that guides agency.


Social Reality =
(A) Totality of Agents

(B) Reality independent of agents (the material and physical substrate)

(C) Objects as aggregated, constructed, or institutionalized by agents

(D) Shared cognition (collective beliefs, meanings, symbols, and expectations)

(E) Interactions and relations among agents (communication, exchange, coordination, conflict, etc.)

(F) Emergent structures (institutions, norms, systems, and roles that arise from repeated interactions)

Structure of  Humans Action:

- : Shared Cognition
- : Just Nature
- : Nature' Modify by «Human Action» - To Embed Meaning
- : Nature' Modify by «Human Action» - Withtou Embedin Meaning - or Just Nature
