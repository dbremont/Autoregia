- If $X$, and $Y$ are independent, does $\text{Var}(X +Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y)$?
- What is a pool variance?
- How to prove the consistency of estimators?
- Distribution:
   - What is the relationship between a probability distribution and a histogram?
   - What are the limits of what a distribution can tell me about a system?
   - How to get my sampling distributions? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_distribution; for  a given random variable.

- How to make sense about the idea of expectation of MLE estimators?
  - We have a set of samples; and infinite set of size n;  compute …
  - I really need to practice taking ; and reflecting deeply about the expectations of the estimators.
  - The expected value of an estimator should equal the true parameter. In general, this method appears tautological. The tautology arises from taking the expectation of the MLE estimator, which hardly constitutes a derivation from first principles, since it implicitly relies on assumptions such as the estimator following a particular distribution.
  - The sample mean is not an estimator; is just a statistic.; a functional.
  - The mean is the estimator.
  - How to reason about the properties of estimator schemes like MLE, MoM?
      - MLE chooses the parameter that **makes the observed data most likely**, which is the most direct way to infer the unknown parameter from data.
      - I need to pause and think more deeply about probability distributions—what the mean, median, mode, variance, etc., represent, and how we compute them.
      - **`…`**
- Let say we are estimating a parameter uniform (5, b); in the likehood function; we have parameter defining the support of the distribution. (i.e. parameters in the indicator!) -  how this affect the use of the CLT?
- What is the z score?
- How partial derivatives works? - Take $f(x, y) = x ^2 + 2y$
- Take the definition of a group and its properties — associativity, commutativity (when present), etc. What are the deep consequences of these properties?
